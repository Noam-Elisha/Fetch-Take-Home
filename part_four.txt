Assuming slack message:

Hi,

I've been looking through the dataset you sent me and I have some questions:

1. Is there a wider dataset containing information regarding brand CPGs and brand categories?

2. For the user lastLogin value: if this value is missing, does that mean the user has never logged in?

3. Could you please explain how brands are considered to be a "Top Brand" or not?

4. What does a barcode of 4011 mean? This seems to be a default value applied to some items inconsistently.

As I was looking through the data, I found a few issues that
may be worth looking into:

1. There are a number of receipts in the dataset that have no rewardsReceiptItemList. 
    How can we have a receipt without any items?

2. There are 484 Receipts with no purchasedItemCount. These correlate strongly with
    the receipts that have no item list, but there are some that all come from one user
    and all have the same one item on them. They are pending approval.

3. As far as individual products go: over 50% of the products in the dataset
    have no barcode, and no user flagged barcode. This could be a problem for
    creating a more robust dataset in the future. In addition to that about 10% of the dataset
    is about items that are not found, either with no description, or no barcode at all, or
    the barcode is 4011

4. For brand data, about 38% of the brands are test brands. I've decided to not include
    these brands in the analysis.

5. Of those brands that are not test brands, about 21% have no category, and
    more severely, about 88% have no category code, which could be important
    for scaling the dataset in the future.

6. Lastly, in the users dataset, over half of the data is duplicate data. Aside from that
    there a few inconsistencies that seem to be related to old accounts from employees.
    These could be cleaned or be removed as they won't provide value in future analysis.

Thank you,
Noam
